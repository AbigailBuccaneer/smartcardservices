Slots: there is a minimum number of slots that the PKCS#11 will start out w/
	These will be empty w/ removable media

	If more than the minimum # of slots exist, then the list will grow to accomodate
	When any slot is 'removed' then it is removed only at the following condition:
		Refresh requested (list slots) AND the # of slots is greater than the max idle

	On refresh, if the slot is to be removed, but is in use, it is kept around until the next refresh

Slot IDs increment from 0 -> max - 1

If a slot is removed and there are active slots above it numerically, then it 'will' be present.
