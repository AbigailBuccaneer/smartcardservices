\f0\fs20 Thank you for your interest in the Smart Card Services project and for agreeing to be a Smart Card Services 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 (SCS) Committer.   The following are some licensing-related requirements that must be followed in order to 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 ensure that all code committed to the Smart Card Services source repository is properly licensed, so as to 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 protect all users of Smart Card Services and to avoid downstream problems.  If you have questions about any of 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 these requirements, please contact the Smart Card Services team at admin@macosforge.org. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20  
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 Before committing code to the Smart Card Services source repository, please ensure that these requirements are 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 met: 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20  
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 1.  All source code must contain a copyright header that includes the author/copyright holder's name(s) and 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 email address(es) for contact purposes. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20  
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 2.  All code committed to the Smart Card Services source repository must be governed by either the LGPL 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 Version 2.1 <
\f2  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>
\f0  for code going into the SmartCardCCID 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 subproject, or the Apple Public Source License 2.0 <http://www.opensource.apple.com/apsl/> for code going 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 into all other SCS subprojects, unless otherwise cleared by Apple in writing.  This means that you should verify 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 that each source file contains either a copy of the appropriate APSL 2.0 license or LGPL 2.1 license text, or a 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 license header stating that it is governed by either such license as appropriate to the SCS subproject in question.  
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 All other licenses are not acceptable unless cleared by Apple in writing. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20  
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 3. As a general rule, contributions to existing APSL2.0-licensed SCS projects should be also licensed
\f1\fs24   \

\f0\fs20 under the APSL 2.0, and contributions to existing LGPL 2.1-licensed SCS projects should be licensed
\f1\fs24  
\f0\fs20 under the 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 LGPL 2.1.  If you come across a conflicting license situation or some other licensing aspect you are unsure 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 about, please contact the Smart Card Services team before committing it to the repository.  Under no 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 circumstances should code licensed under the GPL (any version) or the LGPL v3 be committed to the 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 repository.

\f0\b\fs20  
\f1\b0\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 4.  If a contributed source file does not have any licensing terms attached to it, do not commit it to the 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 repository.  Instead, please contact the author to determine what the intended licensing terms are.  If you need 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 assistance with this, contact the Smart Card Services team.

\f0\fs20 5.  Any code that itself contains any encryption code or algorithm, or utilizes the cryptographic functionality of 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 another software program should not be checked in to the Smart Card Services source repository without first 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 clearing it with the Apple Smart Card Services team and having it approved in writing.  The reason for this is 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 that cryptographic code may be subject to various governmental regulations that Apple and Smart Card Services 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 users must comply with. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20  
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 In addition, please be on the lookout for "legal" notices, legends or terms and conditions in contributed source 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 code that may indicate that the contributed code is subject to restrictions that would inhibit or limit public 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 distribution of the contribution.  Words or terms such as "confidential", "proprietary", "trade secret", "patent", 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 "restricted", "internal use only", "all rights reserved", "license" or "rights", or any other language purporting to 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 grant to reserve any rights to use or distribute the contribution should be brought to the attention of the Smart 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs20 Card Services team before committing it to the Smart Card Services repository.
